  "summary": "The diff adds a Motoko backend actor and a React+TS frontend with routing, Internet Identity auth hooks/components, cart/checkout/orders pages, and a warm neutral Tailwind theme. However, the backend seeding appears to include only a single product (not the required 6+), and the backend product model uses `title` instead of the required `name`. Some requested assets/features cannot be confirmed due to truncation/omitted files.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Seed at least 6 products on fresh deploy so the UI can be demonstrated without manual entry.",
